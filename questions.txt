1. What is the general trend in the curve?

The test accuracy linearly increases as we train more percentage of data from
the data set. The more data used to train, the better the results are.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?

The curve gets noisier as the training data percentage approaches to 0.50(the middle)
from either sides. This is because with either large or small number of training data,
it is trivial that the test accuracies will be really high of low respectively.
And 50% of training data would be a logically true representation of the test
accuracy with the given dataset and therefore it fluctuates a little more.


3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
I got a relatively smooth curve with n = 150. It should be even smoother with
greater values like n = 1000 but it would take a much longer time to run.

4. Try different values for C. What happens?
When I use a higher number for C (c=10**-1), the graph looks like a square-root
plot and the test accuracies sharply increased. When I use a lower number
C(c= 10**-30), the plot became really noisy and the accuracies sharply decreased.
Since we expect linearly proportional results here, I would say the original
value C=10**-10 is a pretty good choice here.
